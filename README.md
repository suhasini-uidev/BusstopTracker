Description:
Bus stop Tracking :- This  project  which demonstrate the path that a bus takes between MIT  and the Harvard university. This project requires the skills in javascript and CSS to create the dynamic experience of moving the marker from one bus stop to another bus stop, here we will pull data from different bus routes and allow the user to choose their bus route they want to see.

Installation:
Make sure all the files are in a directory as listed here:
1. index.html ,mapanimation.js  and styles.css files in the main folder,<Busstoptracker>
2. Open index.html file in any of the browser by
    1. dragging and dropping the index.html file into the browser window you can see how the marker will keep on moving from MIT to Harvard university.
    2. In styles.css we have a grid that allows you to target certain areas of a layout.
    3. In mapanimation.js we will  track and show an animation on a map.  The button should be created  to move the marker from one bus stop to destination bus stop. 

RoadMap:
Later I am hoping to improve my code so that I can create at least one or more  additional features  to this project.
